Created this MySQL project on RETAIL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM as part of my 4th semester coursework of RDBMS.
This Project was made with the idea of understanding the working and creation of database from the very scratch. 
This includes:
--> Creation of ER diagram for the database with proper input of keys and relations
--> Converting the ER diagram into Relational Schema 
--> Using MySQL workbench 8.0 CE for the table creation and query execution
--> Creation of a database, table and altering it.
--> Insertion of Data
--> Executing and working of DML, DLL, DCL commands

Retail management includes controlling all of the business processes and activity that helps customers acquire the desired products (merchandise), services, and experiences from the physical or digital retail stores they value.
Retail management system software (RMS) is the combination of technology a retailer uses to empower the customer experience and operate daily retail management processes, including software, hardware, telecommunications, databases, applications, and the point-of-sale (POS) platform.
All Retails need some variation of a management system. A Retail management system will help with operations of a retail store. This system will be built for a single store that can be scaled up to multiple stores. 
A Retail management system will have multiple benefits for stores such as:
The benefits of RMS often cited by vendors are:
--> Actionable customer data
--> Increased efficiency at the point of sale
--> Enhanced inventory and merchandise management
--> Superior financial transparency
--> Improved security

The schema contains 6 tables: Customers, Office, Employees, Products, orders, orderdetails.

This project was completed with an aim to achieve basic understanding of RDBMS systems and database which is duly fulfilled.
